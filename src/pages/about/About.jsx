            Hi this is Ajay, welcome to my Moderen Blog website. Wait Wait I know this not a great about page, clam down I'm just learning, first let me give introduction about my boring life. Here we go. I'm a software developer based in Bengaluru. Basically I'm from mechanical background, worked as Mechanical Design 
            Engineer for 2.5 years. Every day as a Mechanical Engineer was like hell, Later I decided to quit my job beacause during that period of time I never felt so excited or passionate about what I'm doing. 
            During my college days I always wanted to learn software coding, due to lack of guidance, I couldn't able to follow my dream. So this time I'm
            not going to make the same mistake. Few months back I started over. started learning coding on my own. When I'm coding its just feels like this is the thing I really wanted do in the whole world. currently I'm learning Web Development, I made this Moderen Blog website with what I have learn't till today. 
            I made this site using ReactJS, NodeJS and MongoDB. In this Moderen Blog website users can  write your own blogs on technical 
            field, so that other people can read about them. My final goal is to learn Blockchain Technology and get into Devops. So finally this is about me and my
            Moderen blog website. Good bye, have a great life.
